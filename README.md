Purpose: This program takes 0 or 1 command line arguments and then creates a binary tree.  With 0 arguments the program
    will prompt the user to input strings manually followed by <ctrl+d> and insert them into the tree.  With 1 command
    line argument the program will use the given file to input strings into the tree.  It then prints the trees into
    separate files for each traversal type(Preorder,Inorder,Postorder).
